Hello, friend :) Thank you for visiting my doc/blog experiment.

I'm Josh, a 30-something 'Principal' *Site Reliability Engineer* working from home in _Austin, Texas_.

I left The Cloud to take advantage of the AI gold rush.

Past roles:

* Linux Administrator/DevOps
* Systems Architect
* Stromboli/Pizza/Fry Extraordinaire
